Losing Us â€“ Raisa Anggiani

I love you more than it showed
And you said you feel it too
Thought it was a happy ending
But now it's just beginning

And then you leave me all behind
And you say, "Don't come back again"
And I said

Why would I come back to you
If you don't need me to?
I'll be losing you
And you'll be losing me
